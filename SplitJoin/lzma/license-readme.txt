Parts of this work are derived from the LZMA SDK [1] which is licensed under Public Domain.

The code was originally published on Google code [2] and placed under the MIT license [3] as they did not allow publishing under Public Domain.

When I moved the project to github [4] I kept the MIT license.

If this should prove to be a problem for someone basing his work on this project I'm willing to grant additional Public Domain licensing.
